Would you like a Spring Boot implementation for this Notification Service
(Kafka listener, controller, templates, etc.)?
Or continue to API Gateway or Auth Service next?
Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
Smart E-commerce 38
In a microservices architecture, the API Gateway Service is the single entry
point for all client requests. It routes requests to appropriate services, handles
authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and may provide logging and
response transformation.
You're using Spring Cloud Gateway, so here’s a full guide including API
structure, use cases, and configurations for the API Gateway Service.
✅ API Gateway Service – Spring Cloud Gateway
📍 Base URL: Client-facing → https://api.myecommerce.com/**
📍 Internally proxies to microservices like /product/** , /order/** , etc.
🔧 Main Responsibilities
Feature Handled by Gateway? Notes
Routing requests ✅ Based on path or host
Authentication & JWT parsing ✅ With filter
Rate limiting ✅ Redis-based or in-memory
Circuit breaking ✅ Resilience4j/Hystrix
Load balancing ✅ Eureka + Ribbon
CORS ✅ Global config
Centralized logging/tracing ✅ Sleuth / Zipkin
Request/response transformation ✅ Optional pre/post filters
🚀 Sample Routes Configuration ( application.yml )
spring:
 cloud:
 gateway:
 discovery:
 locator:
 enabled: true
 lower-case-service-id: true
 routes:
 - id: product-service
Smart E-commerce 39
 uri: lb://PRODUCT-SERVICE
 predicates:
 - Path=/product/**
 filters:
 - AuthenticationFilter
 - id: order-service
 uri: lb://ORDER-SERVICE
 predicates:
 - Path=/order/**
 filters:
 - AuthenticationFilter
 - id: auth-service
 uri: lb://AUTH-SERVICE
 predicates:
 - Path=/auth/**
 - id: cart-service
 uri: lb://CART-SERVICE
 predicates:
 - Path=/cart/**
 filters:
 - AuthenticationFilter
lb:// indicates load-balanced discovery via Eureka
🛡 Example: Custom Authentication Filter
JWT token is validated before forwarding request:
@Component
public class AuthenticationFilter extends AbstractGatewayFilterFactory<Au
thenticationFilter.Config> {
 public Mono<Void> apply(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilter
Chain chain) {
Smart E-commerce 40
 // Check Authorization Header
 if (!exchange.getRequest().getHeaders().containsKey(HttpHeaders.AU
THORIZATION)) {
 throw new RuntimeException("Missing Authorization Header");
 }
 String token = exchange.getRequest().getHeaders().get(HttpHeaders.
AUTHORIZATION).get(0).substring(7);
 // Validate JWT (decode/verify with public key or secret)
 Claims claims = jwtUtil.validateToken(token);
 // Add user info to request
 exchange.getRequest().mutate()
 .header("X-User-Id", claims.getSubject())
 .build();
 return chain.filter(exchange);
 }
 public static class Config { }
}
📑 Exposed Endpoints (for DevOps/Admin)
These are not routed to downstream services, but for monitoring the gateway
itself.
Method Endpoint Description
GET /actuator/gateway/routes Lists all routes
GET /actuator/health Health status of gateway
GET /actuator/metrics Performance metrics
GET /actuator/loggers Logging configuration
POST /actuator/gateway/refresh Refresh routes dynamically
🧠 Optional Enhancements

Feature How
Swagger
Aggregation
Combine all microservices’ Swagger docs via SpringDoc
Gateway Aggregation
Rate Limiting Redis-based using RequestRateLimiter
Tracing Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin
Circuit Breaker Add - CircuitBreaker filter with fallback URI
💡 API Gateway Has No "Business APIs"
Unlike other services, the API Gateway doesn’t have REST APIs like /create ,
/get , etc. Instead, it:
Exposes microservices' APIs under a unified domain
e.g. https://api.myecommerce.com/order/create
Adds filters (auth, logging, limits)
Forwards to internal services via Eureka or static URLs
🧪 Example Request Flow via Gateway
Request:
GET https://api.myecommerce.com/order/ORD123
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...
Gateway:
1. Auth filter validates JWT
2. Injects X-User-Id into header
3. Forwards to ORDER-SERVICE via Eureka
Final Internal Request:
GET http://ORDER-SERVICE/order/ORD123
X-User-Id: 102
Would you like help setting up a Spring Cloud Gateway project, or move to the
next service like Authentication (JWT + OAuth2)?
Smart E-commerce 42
Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
Here’s a complete guide for designing the Authentication & Authorization
Service for your Spring Boot Microservices architecture using OAuth2 +
JWT.
✅ Authentication & Authorization Service
This service handles login, registration, JWT token generation, validation,
role-based access, and optionally refresh tokens.
📍 Base URL: /api/auth
📌 Key Components
Component Purpose
JWT Token-based stateless auth
OAuth2 Support for Google, Facebook, etc. (optional)
Spring Security Auth, role/permission enforcement
Password Encoder BCrypt encoding
User Roles ROLE_USER , ROLE_ADMIN , etc.
Token Filter Validates token for incoming requests
📑 Authentication API Endpoints
1. 🔐 Register a New User
POST /api/auth/register
Request:
{
 "username": "john_doe",
 "email": "john@example.com",
 "password": "secret123",
Smart E-commerce 43
 "roles": ["USER"] // Optional, default is USER
}
Response:
{
 "message": "User registered successfully"
}
2. 🔑 Login (Generate JWT Token)
POST /api/auth/login
Request:
{
 "username": "john_doe",
 "password": "secret123"
}
Response:
{
 "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
 "refreshToken": "d9fa8d2d-eabc-4d8f-b2b3-99a...",
 "expiresIn": 3600
}
3. 🔄 Refresh Token
POST /api/auth/refresh-token
Request:
{
 "refreshToken": "d9fa8d2d-eabc-4d8f-b2b3-99a..."
}
Response:
{
Smart E-commerce 44
 "token": "new-jwt-token",
 "expiresIn": 3600
}
4.  Get Current User Info
GET /api/auth/me
Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response:
{
 "id": 1,
 "username": "john_doe",
 "email": "john@example.com",
 "roles": ["ROLE_USER"]
}
5. 🔒 Validate Token (Internal)
POST /api/auth/validate
Request:
{
 "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
Response:
{
 "valid": true,
 "userId": 101,
 "roles": ["ROLE_USER"]
}
Used by other microservices for token validation.
Smart E-commerce 45
6. 🛑 Logout (Invalidate Refresh Token)
POST /api/auth/logout
Request:
{
 "refreshToken": "..."
}
Response:
{
 "message": "Logged out successfully"
}
🛠 JWT Token Claims Example
{
 "sub": "101",
 "username": "john_doe",
 "roles": ["ROLE_USER"],
 "iat": 1719667311,
 "exp": 1719670911
}
🔐 Role-Based Access Control
Role Access To
ROLE_USER Orders, cart, product viewing
ROLE_ADMIN Product management, user management
You can secure endpoints like this in other services:
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@GetMapping("/products/admin")
public List<Product> adminOnlyEndpoint() { ... }
Smart E-commerce 46
Or via SecurityConfig :
.antMatchers("/api/products/**").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN")
.antMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
🧠 Integration With Other Microservices
Other services (Product, Order, etc.) do not handle login. They:
Use Spring Security
Intercept JWT from Authorization: Bearer <token>
Decode it using shared secret/public key
Authorize based on roles or user ID
🟢 With Spring Cloud Gateway, this is done via pre-filter.
🗂 Important Files in Spring Boot
File / Class Purpose
SecurityConfig.java Configure HTTP security, filters
JwtUtils.java Generate, parse, validate JWTs
AuthController.java REST APIs for login, register
UserDetailsServiceImpl.java Load user by username
JWTFilter.java Intercepts every request
RefreshTokenService.java Handle refresh tokens (optional)
🔐 Security Best Practices
Use BCrypt for password hashing
Use short-lived access tokens (e.g. 15–30 mins)
Use refresh tokens stored securely (e.g. HttpOnly cookie)
Add rate limiting for login/register APIs
Protect Gateway endpoints with security filters
Use HTTPS only for secure transport
Smart E-commerce 47
💡 Optional Enhancements
✅ 2FA / OTP login
✅ Social login (Google, Facebook)
✅ Blacklist tokens on logout (via DB or cache)
✅ Multi-tenant user handling
Would you like a Spring Boot starter project template for this Auth service?
Or continue with the next service, like Service Registry (Eureka)?
Let me know your next step!
Great! Let’s go over the Service Registry in a microservices architecture, using
Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka (most common choice) or Consul as alternatives.
✅ Service Registry Service
The Service Registry is responsible for:
Keeping track of all running microservices and their locations.
Allowing services to discover each other dynamically (client-side or
server-side discovery).
Supporting load balancing and resilience via integration with Ribbon/Feign.
📦 Tools Used:
Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka (preferred in Spring ecosystem)
Alternative: HashiCorp Consul

👉 Spring Cloud Config (Configuration Service)?
Let me know!
Here's a comprehensive guide for your Configuration Service using Spring
Cloud Config, an essential part of centralized configuration in a Spring Boot
microservices architecture.
✅ Configuration Service Overview (Spring Cloud
Config)
The Configuration Service provides:
Centralized management of application properties
Dynamic reload of config without redeploying
Support for profiles (dev, test, prod), environments, version control (Git)
Secure storage of sensitive data via Vault
📦 Tools Involved
Tool Purpose
Spring Cloud Config Server Serves configuration properties
Git Repository Stores the actual config files
Spring Boot Actuator + Bus Enables live refresh via messaging (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
🔧 1. Config Server Setup

📑 REST APIs Exposed by Config Server
Method Endpoint Description
GET /{application}/{profile} Get config for app & profile
GET /{application}/{profile}/{label} Get config from Git branch/tag
GET /health Health check
POST /actuator/refresh
Trigger manual refresh of config (when
using Spring Cloud Bus)
Example:
GET http://localhost:8888/product-service/dev
Returns:
{
 "name": "product-service",
 "profiles": ["dev"],
 "propertySources": [
 {
 "name": "https://github.com/.../product-service-dev.yml",
 "source": {
 "server.port": 8081,
 "spring.datasource.url": "jdbc:mysql://..."
 }
 }
 ]
}
🧩 Microservice Client Setup (e.g., Product Service)
Dependencies:
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
</dependency>
Smart E-commerce 55
bootstrap.yml or bootstrap.properties :
spring:
 application:
 name: product-service
 cloud:
 config:
 uri: http://localhost:8888
 profile: dev
Replace dev with prod, test, etc., depending on environment.
🔄 Dynamic Config Refresh (Optional)
If you want to dynamically refresh config at runtime using Spring Cloud Bus:
Add dependencies:
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</artifactId> <!-- For RabbitM
Q -->
</dependency>
Enable refresh scope:
@RefreshScope
@RestController
public class SomeConfigAwareController {
 @Value("${some.dynamic.config}")
 private String configValue;
}
Refresh config:
POST http://localhost:8081/actuator/refresh
Smart E-commerce 56
Or broadcast with:
POST http://localhost:8888/actuator/bus-refresh
🔐 Securing Config Server (Recommended)
spring:
 security:
 user:
 name: configuser
 password: secret123
Then call it like:
GET http://configuser:secret123@localhost:8888/product-service/dev
📌 Best Practices
Practice Why?
Use Git or Vault Secure, version-controlled, audit logs
Separate config per profile Dev/test/prod configs differ
Avoid sensitive data in plain text Use Vault or encrypted placeholders
Use @RefreshScope wisely Only for beans that need dynamic refresh
Centralize common config In application.yml (shared for all)
🧪 Health Check & Testing
Config Server: GET http://localhost:8888/actuator/health
Client service: GET /actuator/env or GET /actuator/configprops
🚀 Advanced Enhancements
Use HashiCorp Vault as backend instead of Git
Enable encryption/decryption endpoints for sensitive values
Smart E-commerce 57
Use Consul for config + service registry (alternative to Git+Eureka)
🔗 Real Example Git Config
# product-service-dev.yml
server:
 port: 8081
spring:
 datasource:
 url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/product_db
 username: product_user
 password: secure_pass

👉 Message Broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka)?
Let me know!
Here's a comprehensive breakdown for Kafka Service in your microservices
architecture:
✅ 13. Message Broker – Kafka in Microservices
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform used in microservices for:
Asynchronous communication
Decoupling services
Event-driven architecture
Guaranteed message delivery and replayability
💡 Why Kafka in Microservices?
Smart E-commerce 58
Benefit Description
Scalability Kafka handles high-throughput event streams
Loose Coupling Services publish/subscribe without knowing about each other
Resilience Services can continue independently even if others are down
Event-Driven Design Great for modern reactive/event-sourcing systems
🧱 Architecture
[Product Service] ──> [Kafka Topic: product-events] ──> [Inventory Servi
ce]

 Kafka Broker
 ↓
 [Notification Service, Order Service]
🔧 Kafka Service Setup in Spring Boot
Dependencies (Producer/Consumer):
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
🔁 Common Kafka Concepts
Concept Description
Topic Logical channel to send/receive messages
Producer Publishes messages to a topic
Consumer Listens to messages from a topic
Broker Kafka server instance
Partition Unit of parallelism; each topic has 1+ partitions
Consumer Group Set of consumers sharing the load
Smart E-commerce 59
📑 Common APIs (Kafka-related service APIs)
While Kafka itself is not a REST-based service, your microservices can expose
APIs to publish or monitor Kafka. Examples:
✅ 1. Publish Event (Producer API)
Endpoint (from Order Service):
POST /api/orders/publish
Request Body:
{
 "orderId": "123",
 "status": "PLACED",
 "userId": "u001",
 "total": 199.99
}
Spring Producer Code:
@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, OrderEvent> kafkaTemplate;
@PostMapping("/publish")
public ResponseEntity<String> sendOrder(@RequestBody OrderEvent orde
rEvent) {
 kafkaTemplate.send("order-events", orderEvent.getOrderId(), orderEven
t);
 return ResponseEntity.ok("Order event published");
}
✅ 2. Listen to Event (Consumer Service – e.g., Inventory)
Kafka Consumer Listener:
@KafkaListener(topics = "order-events", groupId = "inventory-group")
public void handleOrderEvent(OrderEvent event) {
Smart E-commerce 60
 // Reduce inventory, log event, etc.
}
✅ 3. Monitor Messages (Optional Admin API)
GET /api/kafka/messages
Returns last n messages from a topic using an internal storage/cache.
🗃 Typical Kafka Topics in Your Architecture
Topic Name Description Publisher Consumers
order-events Order placed/cancelled Order Service
Inventory, Payment,
Notify
payment-events Payment success/failure
Payment
Service Order, Notification
inventory-events
Inventory
reserved/released
Inventory
Service Order, Shipping
shipping-events
Shipment
dispatched/delivered
Shipping
Service Order, Notification
cart-events Cart updates Cart Service
User Service
(analytics)
⚙️ Sample Kafka Config in application.yml
spring:
 kafka:
 bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
 consumer:
 group-id: order-group
 auto-offset-reset: earliest
 key-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeseriali
zer
 value-deserializer: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonD
eserializer
 producer:
 key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
Smart E-commerce 61
 value-serializer: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSeri
alizer
🔒 Security Considerations
Enable SSL/TLS for encryption
Use SASL authentication with Kafka brokers
Validate payloads to avoid injection or malformed events
🔁 Message Format Example
OrderEvent.java
@Data
public class OrderEvent {
 private String orderId;
 private String userId;
 private String status; // CREATED, CANCELLED, etc.
 private Double amount;
}
Kafka will serialize/deserialize this to/from JSON (if configured with
JsonSerializer ).
🔥 Advanced Kafka Patterns
Pattern Use
Dead Letter Topics Handle failed events
Retry Topics For automatic reprocessing
Event Sourcing Persist entire state change history
Compacted Topics Keep only the latest value for a key
🔍 Tools for Kafka Monitoring
Tool Purpose
Smart E-commerce 62
Kafka UI (Confluent Control Center, AKHQ,
Kafdrop)
Browse topics, partitions, messages
Prometheus + Grafana Kafka performance metrics
Zipkin/Jaeger
Distributed tracing if integrated with
Kafka
✅ Best Practices
Practice Reason
Use separate topics per entity Prevents event mixing
Use compact/retention policies wisely Control data size
Don't expose Kafka directly Wrap with APIs or message gateway
Use schemas (Avro/JSON) + validation Prevent contract mismatch

👉 Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation Service?
Let me know!
To build a robust API Documentation Service for your microservices using
Swagger / OpenAPI, here’s a full guide including important concepts,
integration strategy, and example API setups for each microservice.
✅ 14. API Documentation Service –
Swagger/OpenAPI
🔍 What Is It?
Swagger (now OpenAPI Specification) is a framework for describing,
producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful APIs.
With Swagger you get:
Auto-generated API documentation
Interactive testing UI
Consistent and clear contract between frontend & backend
Smart E-commerce 63
Language-agnostic REST interface description
⚙️ Tools in Swagger Ecosystem
Tool Purpose
springdoc-openapi Java/Spring Boot Swagger integration
Swagger UI Web-based UI for exploring/testing APIs
OpenAPI JSON/YAML Machine-readable contract definition
Swagger Editor Edit and visualize OpenAPI specs
🧩 Integration Per Microservice
Each microservice (Product, Order, Cart, etc.) should expose its own Swagger
documentation endpoint, usually at:
GET /v3/api-docs → OpenAPI JSON spec
GET /swagger-ui.html → Interactive Swagger UI
📦 Dependency for Spring Boot (OpenAPI 3)
Add this in every microservice:
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
 <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
 <version>2.5.0</version>
</dependency>
🧾 Sample Configuration (Optional)

🧪 Sample Endpoint Documentation
Product Service
@Operation(summary = "Get product by ID", description = "Returns the det
ails of a product.")
@ApiResponses(value = {
 @ApiResponse(responseCode = "200", description = "Found the produc
t"),
 @ApiResponse(responseCode = "404", description = "Product not foun
d")
})
@GetMapping("/products/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Product> getProductById(@PathVariable Long id) {
 // ...
}
📋 Centralized API Gateway Documentation
You can aggregate all microservice Swagger docs behind your API Gateway
using SpringDoc + Swagger UI with custom configuration, or use tools like:
SwaggerHub (for hosted solutions)
Redocly
Custom UI aggregating /v3/api-docs from all services
🌐 OpenAPI JSON Aggregation Example
Assume:
Product Service: http://product-service/v3/api-docs
Order Service: http://order-service/v3/api-docs
Create a custom Swagger UI frontend or use a gateway route to expose
multiple docs.
🧠 Important Concepts to Document
Smart E-commerce 65
Section Why Important
Title, Version Clear version tracking
Base Path Helps UI routing
Tags Group endpoints (e.g., Orders, Payments)
Schema definitions Explain request/response formats
Security Schemes JWT/OAuth2 integration for secured APIs
🔐 Example: JWT Security in Swagger
@SecurityScheme(
 name = "bearerAuth",
 type = SecuritySchemeType.HTTP,
 scheme = "bearer",
 bearerFormat = "JWT"
)
@Operation(
 summary = "Place an order",
 security = @SecurityRequirement(name = "bearerAuth")
)
📑 API Documentation per Service (Example
